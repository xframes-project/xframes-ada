## Requirements

### Install Ada and Alire

Follow these instructions: https://alire.ada.dev/transition_from_gnat_community.html

Start by installing Alire: https://alire.ada.dev/

You can still download GNAT Studio community edition (the official Ada IDE) here: https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatstudio/releases

That said, The `Ada & SPARK` VS Code extension is also available and it is recommended over GNAT Studio. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AdaCore.ada

#### Raspberry Pi

You need to install `gnat` and `gpruild` though `apt`. You can then proceed to build `alire` (refer to the official documentation). 

### Running the application

Launch an Alire Powershell then run `alr run`
